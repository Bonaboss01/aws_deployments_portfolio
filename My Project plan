🌟 🔥 AWS ML DEPLOYMENTS PORTFOLIO — FULL PLAN 🔥
(Everything you need to deploy ML models on AWS like a professional)

Your portfolio will contain 4 projects, each increasing in difficulty and value.

✅ 📁 PROJECT 1 — EC2 + Flask ML API (Beginner → Deployment)

Goal: Deploy a simple ML model behind a REST API running on an EC2 instance.
AWS Services: EC2, S3 (optional), IAM, Security Groups

✔️ Steps

Pick a simple model

IPO model

Sentiment analysis

Logistic regression
Save it as .pkl.

Create Flask API

/predict endpoint

Load model

Return JSON output

Dockerize the app

Write Dockerfile

Build and test locally

Create EC2 instance

Choose Amazon Linux / Ubuntu

Configure security group

Allow port 5000 or 80

Install Docker on EC2

sudo yum install docker

sudo service docker start

Deploy container to EC2

Copy project → EC2

Run Docker container

Test endpoint with Postman

Document everything in GitHub
